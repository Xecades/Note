# Overview

Here are my notes on various topics. I'm trying to keep them as concise as possible, so that I can review them quickly. The notes are written in Markdown, and I use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the site.

This site is for educational purposes in computer science and mathematics. Not trying to show off, but I hope it could help random people on the Internet or myself when my memory fails me. I'm not a native English speaker, so I guarantee no perfectness of grammar or expressions, but I'll do my best. If you notice any mistakes in my notes, feel free to open an issue or pull request, or simply email me.

## Who am I?

I'm currently an undergraduate student of Zhejiang University, China. You can refer to my [personal website](https://xecades.xyz/) (which is written in Chinese) for further information.

## Why am I using English?

English courses are not required for Turing Class. To make up for that, I'm considering using English for my notes.
