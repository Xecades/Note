# Overview

Here are my notes on various topics. I'm trying to keep them as concise as possible, so that I can review them quickly. The notes are written in Markdown (with $\LaTeX$ embedded). I'm using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the site.

This site is in general for educational purposes in computer science and mathematics. Not trying to *show off*, but I hope it could help random people on the Internet or myself (when my memory fails me). I'm not a native English speaker, so I guarantee no perfectness of grammar or expressions, but I'll do my best to make them not that *strange*. If you notice any mistakes, feel free to open an issue or pull request, or simply email me.

## Who am I?

I'm currently an undergraduate student of Zhejiang University, China. You can refer to my [personal website](https://xecades.xyz/) (which is written in Chinese) for further information. If you have difficulty reading Chinese, here are some of my profiles:

 - **GitHub**: [github.com/Xecades](https://github.com/Xecades)
 - **Telegram**: [t.me/Xecades](https://t.me/Xecades)
 - **Email**: `i#xecades.xyz` or `xecadeszhe#gmail.com` (replace # with @)
 - **QQ**: Check TXT record of `qq.xecades.xyz`

## Why am I using English?

(It is said that) English courses are not required for [Turing Class](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/turingclass_en/). To make up for that, I'm considering using English for my notes.
