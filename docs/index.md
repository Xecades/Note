# Overview

Hi! Here are my notes. These notes are written in Markdown, with LaTeX embedded, and the site is generated using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

This site is in general for educational purposes in computer science and mathematics. It is not intended to *show off*, but I hope it could help random people on the internet or to serve as a personal reference when my memory fails me. As a non-native English speaker, I guarantee no perfectness of grammar or expressions, but I will strive to make them sound as natural as possible. If you notice any mistakes, feel free to open an issue or pull request, or simply email me.

## Who am I?

I am currently an undergraduate student of [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China. You can refer to my [personal website](https://xecades.xyz/) (which is written in Chinese) for further information. If you have difficulty reading Chinese, here are some of my profiles:

 - **GitHub**: [github.com/Xecades](https://github.com/Xecades)
 - **Telegram**: [t.me/Xecades](https://t.me/Xecades)
 - **Email**: `xecadeszhe#gmail.com` or `i#xecades.xyz`\* (replace # with @)
 - **QQ**: Check TXT record of `qq.xecades.xyz`

## Why am I using English?

English courses are not mandatory for [Turing Class](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/turingclass_en/). To make up for that, I am considering using English for my notes.
