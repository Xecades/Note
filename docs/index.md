# Overview

This site is for educational purposes in computer science and mathematics. Not for 'showing off' and I sincerely hope it could help random people on the Internet or even myself when my memory fails me. It's nice to know that I'm not a native English speaker. I guarantee no perfectness of grammar and expressions, but I'll do my best.

## Who am I?

I'm currently an undergraduate student of Zhejiang University, China.

## Why am I using English?

English courses are not required for Turing Class. To make up for that, I'm considering using English for my notes.
