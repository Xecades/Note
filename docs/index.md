# Overview

Here are my notes on various topics. I am trying to keep them concise for quick review. The notes are written in Markdown (with $\LaTeX$ embedded). I am using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the site.

This site is in general for educational purposes in computer science and mathematics. Not trying to *show off*, but I hope it could help random people on the Internet or myself (when my memory fails me). As a non-native English speaker, I guarantee no perfectness of grammar or expressions, but I will do my best to make them not that *strange*. If you come across any mistakes, feel free to open an issue or pull request, or simply email me.

## Who am I?

## Why am I using English?

(It is said that) English courses are not required for [Turing Class](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/turingclass_en/). To make up for that, I am considering using English for my notes.

GitHub Pages *does* collect [IP address](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection), but I don't have access to it. I am using [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) to collect visitor statistics. The only two cookies the site generates are from it. If you prefer not to be tracked, you can use an ad blocker to block it. The only third-party plugin used in this site is [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), which helps to render math notations. I have no idea how to harvest data from MathJax. If you have any other concerns, you can review the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xecades/Notes).
