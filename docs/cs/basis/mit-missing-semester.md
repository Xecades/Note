# MIT Missing Semester

[MIT Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is a course that teaches the *un-taught* parts of computer science.

> Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: **proficiency with their tools**. We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!
